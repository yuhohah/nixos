# Agents

One bar icon and one panel for every AI coding subscription on the machine.
The panel is strictly a display: it watches the usage records that
`omarchy-agent-usage-update` writes to `~/.local/state/omarchy/agents/usage/`
and draws whatever appears there. `Panel.qml` owns the bar button and the
popup; `Main.qml` discovers and watches the records (and handles the optional
cross-device aggregation); `Agent.qml` is the per-record file watcher.

## Panel

- **Hero** — the mark, the tool, and the plan it runs on ("Max 20x", "Pro").
  Auth and endpoint problems replace the plan line and repeat in a card.
- **Subscription switch** — one chip per enabled agent (`h`/`l` or click).
  It appears only when more than one agent is enabled.
- **Limits** — the percentage of each allowance used, a matching meter, and
  the time until the session or weekly window resets.
- **Balance** — prepaid agents report a credit ledger instead of limits:
  remaining credit, a fuel-gauge meter that drains toward empty, and
  funded-versus-spent detail.
- **Tokens by day** — one row per day for the last week: day, bar, tokens, with today
  bolded at the bottom. Hover today for its prompt and session count.
- **Tokens by model** — tokens per model with the bar behind each row scaled
  to the heaviest model,
  the same way the weekly chart scales to its busiest day. Hover for the
  input / output / cache split.

A subscription appears only when it is enabled in settings and has actually
recorded usage — on this machine or on a synced one. With one such agent
there is no switch row at all; with none, the module leaves the bar entirely
rather than sitting there with nothing to say. A CLI installed mid-session
shows up at the next refresh, so nothing polls the disk waiting for it.

That self-hiding is why the widget ships in the default bar layout: a machine
that has never run an AI coding agent draws nothing, and the icon arrives on
its own the first time a scan finds usage. Drop it with
`omarchy plugin disable omarchy.agents`.

## Data

Each agent is one JSON record in `~/.local/state/omarchy/agents/usage/`,
written by `omarchy-agent-usage-update`. That command runs one
`omarchy-agent-usage-<agent>` collector per agent; the widget invokes it
on its refresh timer and whenever you ask for a refresh, and picks up any
record that lands in the directory regardless of who wrote it.

Adding an agent therefore never touches this plugin: ship a collector that
prints the record contract, and the panel gains a tab. An `assets/<id>.svg` mark is optional —
with an `assets/<id>-light.svg` twin if the mark needs a dark variant for
light surfaces — and the bar glyph stands in when there is none.

| Collector | Limits | Local stats |
|---|---|---|
| `gemini` | Rolling 5-hour session and 7-day weekly limits | Antigravity IDE transcripts in `~/.gemini/antigravity-ide/brain` and `gemini` CLI sessions |

### Gemini Configuration

The collector automatically reads Antigravity IDE and `gemini` CLI transcripts.
Optional configuration can be placed in `~/.config/omarchy/agents/gemini.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Google Gemini",
  "tier": "Advanced",
  "apiKey": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY",
  "sessionLimit": 50,
  "weeklyLimit": 500
}
```

## Interactions

- Bar icon: left = panel, right = launch agent, middle = next subscription.
- Panel: `h`/`l` switch subscription, `j`/`k` scroll, `r` or Enter refresh,
  Tab moves to the neighboring bar panel, Esc closes.
- IPC: `omarchy-shell omarchy.agents <open|close|toggle|refresh|next>`.

## Settings

Settings live in the widget's entry in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`. The
top-level keys can be set with
`omarchy bar set omarchy.agents <key> <value>`:

| Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `refreshIntervalSec` | `900` | How often the usage records regenerate |
| `syncMode` | `"Off"` | `"On"` writes this machine's snapshot and merges the others |
| `syncDir` | `""` | A folder synced by Syncthing, Dropbox, rsync, … |
| `syncFileName` | `<hostname>.json` | This machine's snapshot file |
| `syncDeviceId` | hostname | Stable device name inside the snapshot |

Numbers need `--json`, or they land in `shell.json` as strings:

```bash
omarchy bar set omarchy.agents refreshIntervalSec 300 --json
omarchy bar set omarchy.agents syncDir '~/Sync/agent-usage'
```

Per-agent enablement is nested, and `set` writes its key literally rather
than walking a dotted path — so pass the whole `providers` object as JSON (or
edit `shell.json` directly):

```bash
omarchy bar set omarchy.agents providers '{
  "gemini": { "enabled": true }
}' --json
```

`enabled` defaults to `true` for every discovered agent; set it to `false` to
hide a subscription that is installed. Disabled agents are also skipped when
the records regenerate.

With `syncMode` on, every `*.json` snapshot in `syncDir` is merged, so today,
the last 7 days, and the all-time totals cover every machine you code on —
active days are unioned by date rather than summed. Rate limits stay
per-account and are never merged.
